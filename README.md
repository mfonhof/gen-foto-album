# gen-foto-album
Generate index.html files to create an foto album in an directory with subdir's.

bash script

strait forward: go to top level dir and start ge-foto-album.sh
See there is no dir with a "'" in it. It will ignore the dir.

Put a random photo in a dir if it has only subdirs and no photo's to add a photo
to the menu. Otherway's you see an dir icon.
